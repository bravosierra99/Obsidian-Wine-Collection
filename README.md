# My Wine Collection with Obsidian

## Introduction
A year ago, I started to dive deeper into the world of wine. I wanted to get a better understanding of the different varieties, the influences of the land, the winemaker, and the vintage. So I started to buy different wines at my local food store and tasted them one by one. After some months, I didn’t remember exactly which wine was good and which one was not. I made first notes with Obsidian, the number of notes increased (and the clarity decreased), I set it up again, … improved it, and now I have my final setup, which I wanted to share with you.

My setup is for wine, but you can modify it easily and track your craft beers, different coffee beans, whiskies, gins, or whatever you like. 

I use Obsidian and the following plugins:
- Dataview
- Metadata Menu
- QuickAdd
- Paste image rename

and the Minimal Theme with its helper plugins
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Style Settings

Additionally, I use "![The Unlabeler](https://unlabeler.app/)" app (for iOS/iPad/MacOS) to get nice, undistorted, and rectangular wine labels. 

## Step-by-step Approach
The best way is to start with a new vault. I named it "WineCellar“, which is much more appealing than "WineFridge“. Go to Settings (or Preferences at MacOS) -> Options: Community plugins -> Turn on community plugins -> Browse and install and enable the six plugins named above.

Then install the Minimal theme (Settings -> Options: Appearance -> Themes -> Manage. Search for "Minimal“ and click on "install and use“. 

Let’s make some folders to start with (I use numbers at the beginning to have a proper sorting):
0_Collection
1_Wines
8_FileClass
9_Templates


Now we have to change some settings:
