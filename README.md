# My Wine Collection with Obsidian

## Introduction
A year ago, I started to dive deeper into the world of wine. I wanted to get a better understanding of the different varieties, the influences of the land, the winemaker, and the vintage. So I started to buy different wines at my local food store and tasted them one by one. After some months, I didn’t remember exactly which wine was good and which one was not. I made first notes with Obsidian, the number of notes increased (and the clarity decreased), I set it up again, … improved it, and now I have my final setup, which I wanted to share with you.

My setup is for wine, but you can modify it easily and track your craft beers, different coffee beans, whiskies, gins, or whatever you like. 

I use Obsidian and the following plugins:
- Dataview
- Metadata Menu
- QuickAdd
- Paste image rename

and the Minimal Theme with its helper plugins
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Style Settings

Additionally, I use "![The Unlabeler](https://unlabeler.app/)" app (for iOS/iPad/MacOS) to get nice, undistorted, and rectangular wine labels.
